# Generate the list of keywords in Emerald, according to `parsedef.m`
# and `tokNames.m` under ../EC. Together, these two files declare the
# keywords in Emerald as follows:
#
#   * `parsedef.m` declares an Emerald constant for each keyword.
#      The keyword constants begin with the letter 'K', and continue
#      with the keyword in all caps. For instance, `KRETURN` for the
#      keyword "return".
#
#   * `tokNames.m` declares an Emerald array of strings, where the
#      offset of each keyword corresponds to the constant value it
#      gets above.
#
# This script assumes more simply, that the keywords in `paraedef.m`
# occur in the same order as in `tokNames.m`. However, this script
# does fail if that assumption does not hold.
#
# The algorithm:
#
#   1. Combine parsedef.m and tokNames.m into one file, skipping the
#      first line of tokNames.m.
#   2. Extract only those lines that declare keywords (const K..).
#   3. From each line, extract the keyword constant suffix, and the
#      keyword string (without quotes).
#   4. Make sure the keyword constant suffix corresponds to the
#      keyword string, lest the casing.
#   5. If all looks well, list the keyword strings found above.
#   6. Sort and show unique keywords in a case-insensitive manner.
