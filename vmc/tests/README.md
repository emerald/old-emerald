# `vmc` Tests

The role of `vmc` in the Emerald compiler is at present unclear, hence
its intended behaviour is also _unclear_.

The purpose of this test-suite is therefore to make a snapshot of the
_current_ behaviour of `vmc`, right or wrong, before any subsequent
changes are made to the code base (e.g., to bring `vmc` up-to-date
with contemporary C development standards).

## Design

`vmc` is a compiler that generates C code. For an input `.desc` file,
it generates 3 C files, ending in `desc.c`, `desc.h`, and `desc_i.h`,
respectively. For instance, for the empty file
[empty.desc](data/empty.desc), `vmc` generates
[empty.desc.c](data/empty.desc.c), [empty.desc.h](data/empty.desc.h),
and [empty.desc_i.h](data/empty.desc_i.h).

The `vmc` are therefore structured as follows:

1. The code generated for the empty file [empty.desc](data/empty.desc)
   is stored in Git as [empty.desc.c](data/empty.desc.c),
   [empty.desc.h](data/empty.desc.h), and
   [empty.desc_i.h](data/empty.desc_i.h).
2. For all other sample inputs (e.g.,
   [empty_defs.desc](data/empty_defs.desc)), only the input file and
   a _patch_ are stored to reduce code duplication.
  1. The patch is generated by [gen-patch.sh](gen-patch.sh).
  2. The code generated for a given input file can be restored from
     the patch using [gen-data.sh](gen-data.sh).
