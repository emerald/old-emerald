# The Emerald Makefile Style Guide

## Variables

Variables should be [_simply
expanded_](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Flavors.html)
(declared using `:=`), unless there is a clear need for _recursively
expanded_ variables (declared using `=`).

## Phony Targets

All [_phony
targets_](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html)
(i.e., targets which do not correspond to a filename generated by the
given recipe) must be marked as such.
